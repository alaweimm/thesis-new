	abstract = {The ability to control nanoscale electronic properties by introducing macroscopic strain is of critical importance for the implementation of two-dimensional (2D) materials into flexible electronics and next-generation strain engineering devices. In this work, we correlate the atomic-scale lattice deformation with a systematic macroscopic bending of monolayer molybdenum disulfide films by using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy implemented with a custom-built sample holder to control the strain. Using this technique, we are able to induce strains of up to 3\% before slipping effects take place and relaxation mechanisms prevail. We find a reduction of the quasiparticle bandgap of about 400 meV per percent local strain measured with a minimum gap of 1.2 eV. Furthermore, unintentional nanoscale strain relaxation of van der Waals monolayer sheets can negatively impact strain engineered device performance. Here we investigate such strain relaxation mechanisms that include one-dimensional ripples and 2D wrinkles which alter the spatial electronic density of states and strain distribution on the atomic scale.},

Five typical defects are introduced to estimate the instability characteristics of defective MoS2 sheet. The buckling responses, including the critical strain and geometric morphology, influenced by defect type, stain rate, defect density and so on, are comprehensively explored. It is found that different type of defects results in reduction of the bending modulus to some different extent. Compared with the other three post-buckling morphologies, the first typical geometric morphology show the biggest difference between the defect-free and defective SLMoS2 sheets. It seems possible to realize our desired morphology in flexible electronics by proper preparing different kinds of defects. The finding in the present paper should be useful for the promising design of flexible optoelectronic devices and soft bioelectronics.},

It is found that both the critical stress and equivalent elastic modulus of SLMoS2 sheets with kirigami-inspired structures are reduced significantly compared with perfect ones. The geometric parameters of kirigami-inspired structures in armchair and zigzag directions have different effects on the compressive behavior of SLMoS2 sheets. SLMoS2 sheets that sustain more strain could be realized by introducing kirigami-inspired structures. What is more, a desired post-bulking morphology can be obtained by properly tuning kirigami-inspired structures.

The difference between the suspended and substrate-supported SLMoS2 sheets is compared. The effect of substrate surface morphology, including the groove and periodic surface microstructure substrate, on the buckling behavior is mainly focused. It is found that the critical strain increases significantly compared with the suspended SLMoS2 sheets due to the introduction of the underlying substrate. The evolution of SLMoS2 sheets on substrates with grooves contains two different paths depending on the groove height and the width. Additionally, both the period and effective contact area of the surface microstructure have direct impacts on the critical strain.

              Recently, it has been revealed that dark excitons play a significant role in optically controlled information processing due to their much longer radiative lifetimes than those of bright ones. For the realizable implementation of the features, it is important to understand and manipulate conditions in which dark excitons could exist. We adopt strain-engineered rippling as a new parameter for the modification of the electronic structure of monolayer MoS

              and demonstrate the efficient conversion of bright to dark excitons

This phenomenon can be explained from charge redistribution under external electric field by a simple model.

Here our extensive first-principles calculations reveal that structural wrinkling and corrugation will cause significant flexoelectricity in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers. The flexoelectricity is induced by the strain gradients created along the finite thickness of the wrinkled TMD monolayers and becomes more dominant in determining out-of-plane polarizations with decreasing wavelengths of the TMD wrinkles. According to the first-principles calculations and whole structural symmetry, a theoretical model is developed to describe the total out-of-plane polarizations and flexoelectric effect of the wrinkled TMD monolayers. The unveiled flexoelectricity in monolayer TMDs highlights a potential for their application in energy conversion devices.},

Nanoindentation simulations are performed using three indenter sizes with specific focus on the incipient plastic deformation event within the MoS2single crystal. MS calculations show that a local phase transformation occurs beneath the indenter at plastic yield without the presence of broken Mo–S bonds. The structural characteristics of the phase transformation are captured using a slip vector analysis. The nanoindentation simulations provide insight into the mechanical response of MoS2 during contact deformation characteristic of both synthesis and application for better design of MoS2 nanoparticle lubricants.},

The resulting potential is able to yield good agreement with the structure and energetics of Mo molecules, two-dimensional Mo structures, three-dimensional Mo crystals, small S molecules, and binary Mo-S crystal structures. We illustrate the capabilities of the new potential by presenting results of the simulation of friction between MoS2 layers.

	abstract = {Dimensionality plays an essential role in determining the anomalous non-Fermi liquid properties in heavy fermion systems. So far most heavy fermion compounds are quasi-two-dimensional or three-dimensional. Here we report the synthesis and systematic investigations of the single crystals of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice CeCo2Ga8. Resistivity measurements at ambient pressure reveal the onset of coherence at T * ≈ 20 K and non-Fermi liquid behavior with linear temperature dependence over a decade in temperature from 2 to 0.1 K. The specific heat increases logarithmically with lowering temperature between 10 and 2 K and reaches 800 mJ/mol K2 at 1 K, suggesting that CeCo2Ga8 is a heavy fermion compound in the close vicinity of a quantum critical point. Resistivity measurements under pressure further confirm the non-Fermi liquid behavior in a large temperature–pressure range. The magnetic susceptibility is found to follow the typical behavior for a one-dimensional spin chain from 300 K down to T *, and first-principles calculations predict flat Fermi surfaces for the itinerant f-electron bands. These suggest that CeCo2Ga8 is a rare example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice, but its non-Fermi liquid behaviors resemble those of the quasi-two-dimensional YbRh2Si2 family. The study of the quasi-one-dimensional CeCo2Ga8 family may therefore help us to understand the role of dimensionality on heavy fermion physics and quantum criticality.},
